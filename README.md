# liri-node-app

Use liri node app to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. 

Depending on which, a user will type in the terminal one of the following:
  -spotify-this-song
  -movie-this
  -concert-this
  
Followed by the song, movie, or name of the artist they're looking for more information about. 

For example, if one types node liri.js spotify-this-song Heartache Tonight in the terminal, they will see this:
